TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
Breaks up large messages into something called packets. A packet is a segment of data that, when combined with other packets, make up one whole message. Things like websites are broken into packets, then sent over the Internet.
The receiving computer reassembles the packets back into the whole message. Breaking it up into packets makes it so that the data is easier to transfer through the Internet. Some packets can get to the destination first, while if the 
message was being sent as a whole, it will have to wait a long time for the message to come.
However, sometimes the packets can get either lost, corrupted, or delayed, when travelling through the Internet. If this was not fixed, the image either would not load, have missing bits, corrupted, all everything. Packets experience these troubles
because they go through various nodes. These nodes are basically different routers or computers. One route might experience more interference (causing packet loss), another might be faster or slower than another (causing packets to become out of order). Corruption
can happen at any time through electric interference. TCP is a protocol that solves these issues.
Computers first do a TCP handshake, which is two computers telling each other that they will be using TCP for data transfer, and making sure the connection is continued throughout the data transfer. Then, they do something called ordering. TCP puts something called a
sequence number on each of the packets, which signifies its order number. With the sequence number, the receiving computer can re-order the packets into the correct order. If the packets are out of order, TCP will wait until all of the packets arrive, then puts them 
back in order. Another concept is called checksums. Checksums is a little piece of data in the data that is being transferred. If the data gets corrupted, then the checksum will detect it, and in some cases, will repair that error. TCP uses something called acknowledgement
(ACK) and negative acknowledgement (NACK) messages to re-send data. ACKs are sent to the sending computer from the receiving computer to tell the sending computer the data has arrived and it is usable. NACKs are sent when the data arrives, but is damaged and cannot be
used, so the sending computer has to send the packet again. ACKs and NACKs are useful because they allow communication in the opposite direction. Finally, the sending computer will resend a packet if it has not receiving an ACK or NACK after some time for that specific
packet. This is called a timeout. Sometimes, ACKs can actually get lost too, but TCP ignores duplicates.

UDP - User Datagram Protocol
This is similar to TCP, however this protocol does not guarantee delivery. UDP does not do anything for duplicate packets, lost packets, or out of order packets. All it does is it gets the bulk of the data to one place. Checksums are still used to make sure the data is
not corrupted. The packets of data still have formal packet structure, as it includes destination, origin, and packet size. UDP is usually used for "unimportant" data transfer, such as music, video, and VOIP. For example, sometimes video calls on Skype can suddenly become
very poor quality, and that is because UDP has lost some packets in the transfer process. However, the bulk of the data has been transferred successfully, so the user can still see the overall picture and the conversation can function fine.
