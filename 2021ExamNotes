Possible future uses or improvements in the field of network communication:
  > Security:
    As devices become more and more common in everyday life - from smart fridges to connected healthcare devices - security will be of the utmost importance. There will need to be more advanced encryption standards, which we do have currently, but as computer processing power increases, more advanced encryption technology will be necessary to prevent data breaches and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Implementing a zero trust model in devices can also up the security levels, as it ensures that every device needs to be authenticated and verified. This is critical for managing sensitive data.
  > Compatibility:
    With more devices, comes more device types. And thus, comes the need of communicating seamlessly across all devices. This will be particularly important across "hi-tech" cities such as Japan, where different types of devices need to communicate. More universal protocols needs to be created, OR, some sort of protocol translation software can also play a major role in allowing higher compatibility between different kinds of devices.
  > Efficient Data Transfer:
    Networks often rely on low power and low bandwith communication methods especially when devices are deployed in remote or resource-constrained areas. As devices become more common, reducing data transfer size efficiently will be crucial for reliability and scalability. Protocols will need to start to allow more data to be processed locally on devices, rather than sending them to the cloud to process. This can reduce the data load and latency, enabling a faster response time for things such as auto-driving cars.
    
In conclusion, as devices become more common, there will be a need for more improvements to be made to existing Network Communication Protocols. This will also open the path for more jobs, and thus can potentially increase global economy.
